# React Component Module Federation Example
An example of how Module Federation works with Remote React Components...

The nice thing about Module Federation is that it can somewhat automatically de-dupe dependencies.

The remote component webpack is configured to chunk each dependency as a separate file
Both the host app and the remote use axios
When the component loads, the browser doesn't need to grab axios, since that dependency requirement is already satisfied by the host

To run... easiest with two terminal windows

* Host:
  * `cd host-server; npm i; npm run start ` 

* Component:
  * `cd remote-component; npm i; npm run serve`


App: http://localhost:3000/
